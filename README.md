# Secure Password Checker in C using OpenSSL

The project is written in C and uses the OpenSSL library to securely hash and verify passwords using SHA-256. The program prompts the user to enter a password, salts it, hashes it using SHA-256 and compares it to a stored hash. If the hashes match, access is granted and otherwise, access is denied.
